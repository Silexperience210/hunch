// AMM quote layer over the LMSR core (lib/lmsr.ts) — turns a market's current probability into an
// instant, 1-click bettable price. The mint acts as market maker: it always quotes a YES/NO price
// that moves with the size of your bet (slippage), with worst-case subsidy bounded by b·ln2.
//
// This is the AMM half of Hunch's hybrid AMM+CLOB design: the order book (lib/orderbook) still
// carries resting limit orders, while the AMM gives instant liquidity so no market is ever
// un-bettable on day one. Pricing is anchored on the book's implied probability when there is
// two-sided demand, else 50/50. The actual bet uses the proven deposit→mintLocked→redeem path.
//
// All pure + offline-tested.
